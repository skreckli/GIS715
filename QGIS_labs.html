                <p> In QGIS, flight paths between three US airports were styled to look 'neon' against a black US states polygon layer.
                    To achieve the desired effect, the flight paths were assigned a neon pink color and an outer glow with a spread of 5 and a blur of 3 was applied.
                    A second simple line was created to further highlight the flight path neon effect.</p>

                <p>In QGIS, ocean bathymetry layers were styled to create a 'wood carving' effect and land masses were styled to combine shaded relief with a solid color.
                    To achieve the desired effects, an inner shadow draw effect was enabled on each bathymetry layer.  The shaded relief land mass layer
                    was combined with a solid colored layer by setting the 'layer' = 'multiply' in the 'Layer Rendering' panel of the 'QGIS Layer Styling' window.</p>

                <h3>Layer Blending</h3>
                <p>In QGIS, a DEM of the Jemez, NM region was displayed as hillshade and blended with a land owndership layer.  This was overlaid with a PLSS Townships layer.
                    In the image on the left, the desired effect was achieved by setting the setting the land ownership styling to 'layer' = 'multiply' in the 'Layer Rendering' panel of the 'QGIS Layer Styling' 
                    window.  An overlay blending mode was applied to the PLSS townships layer.  In the image on the right, the map layout was altered so that the blending mode multiply was applied to the 'made with QGIS' graphic.
                    Labels referring to the townships were added to the layout using a soft light blending mode.  </p>

                <p>In QGIS, a Denmark road network was styled so that the most dense areas of roads were more apparent than less dense areas.  The desired effect was 
                    achieved by setting the 'feature' = 'addition' in the 'Layer Rendering' panel of the 'QGIS Layer Styling' window.

                <h3>Shapeburst USA map</h3>
                <p>In QGIS, a United States polygon layer was styled to look like an old-fashioned USA map.  The desired effect was 
                    achieved by running the 'topological coloring' tool which created a field in the states attribute table for colors 1-5.
                    Next, a categorical color ramp was chosen shuffling random colors.  This layer was copied and added to the contents two times.
                    The first copy was applied a shapeburst effect by assigning it a shapeburst fill in the styling window.  The second states layer copy was
                    made to look a random gray dot boundary by setting the offset to 'concat('0,', 3*randf(0,1)^3)'.  The layers were applied differing levels of opacity
                    to achieve the final map effect.
