    <p>Viewsheds were computed for 4 locations in Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, NC. A 3d model of each viewshed was created in Blender and uploaded to Sketchfab to visualize.  Each viewshed is numbered and is shaded in purple which fades to mint green.
    Additionally, a 3D model of Dorothea Dix Park was created from a DEM in Blender and draped with an orthophoto.  The model was uploaded to Sketchfab.  The Sketchfab visualization of the model with building annotations can be accessed using the link: https://skfb.ly/otNJI.
